# Mobile Stress Tracker: The Mobile Application for Stress Detection from Human Speech

## Deep Learning model generation code and script for its utilization for classification of real-world speech samples

## Description
The work demonstrates the real-time stress detection from the
user’s speech using Android-based mobile device. Additionally,
the personalized approach of the application allows training
on the fly for user-specific models to get better performance.
The application achieves the top accuracy of 84.67% for stress
detection in the environment without background noise. Our
created framework utilizes token-based encryption to secure
users’ data and prevent unauthorized usage of the framework.
To the best of our knowledge, our system is currently the only
mobile application for real-time stress detection task using only
the human speech with an adaptation feature. June, 2019
